1. Postgres is cheaper than CosmosDB for Postgres
2. Flexible server is recommended, runs linux, supports more versions & functionality
3. SQL Database has a free tier, but installing odbc in app service is no fun without custom images.

# Backend

1. Function App is not ideal with the long-running state of Django
2. App Service is better. 

# Frontend

1. Static Web App
2. Requires Basic tier for custom authentication
